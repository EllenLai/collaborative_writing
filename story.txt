He didn't know why they were there... but they were.  This is the little story of the boy who did drugs. One day he was walking down the road and stumbled upon a little brown bag, he leaned over and looked inside. It was a totally innocent little brown bag, just like the many others that he had seen floating down the street but he was completely unprepared for what he would find inside. Lo' and behold, distance sirens started to come closer and in a panic, the boy threw the little brown bag down and started running for his life. Suddenly, he heard someone call out his name. "Jesse!"  That someone was the honourable mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford. Red faced, and short of breath, he whispered “Can I have some?”. Jesse, sombrely replied, “No, stay in school.”

The end.
